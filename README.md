# MLRITM-Hyderabad-Attendance-Tracking-Application
This is an Android application built on Java. It's motive and aim is to track student's attendance. As many of the students face issues being marked as absent even though they were present, this application helps them to know about it and take the necessary action regarding it.
The application completely depends on the official college website as it uses web scraping to scrape the data from the college website.
Once logged in, the data will be scrapped from the website and formatted in a table.
If the "Remember me and notify if marked absent" check box is checked while logging in, the user will get a notification if they are marked absent on that day.
Accordingly, the user can take necessary action.
The runtime and the loading time is completely based on the official website server.
